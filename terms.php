                                    <p>8.2 We will endeavour to prepare your order as quickly as reasonable possible and within your collection time slot quoted at the time of ordering. At busy times, there may be some additional waiting time.</p>
                                    <p>8.3 If you do not collect your order within your collection time slot, the quality of your order will gradually diminish and you will not receive a refund for unsatisfactory orders caused by delays in collections by you.</p>

                                    <p>9.5 If you fail to accept your Home Delivery at the time it is being ready delivered or we are unable to deliver at the nominated time and/or address due to your failure to provide appropriate instructions or authorizations, then the order shall be deemed to have been delivered to you.</p>
                                    <p>9.6 In case of a late delivery, the delivery charge will neither be voided nor refunded by us.</p>

The products and services that we provide through the "Platform", regardless of whether fees are charged, are also referred to as "Platform Services". A "Platform Fee" is a fee paid by the Customer to the "Platform Provider" (ePOS Hybrid), in consideration for each individual transaction processed via the "Platform", to help maintaining web, mobile and QR ordering technologies, in addition to any order and delivery fees.</p>

                                        <li>£40.01 to £50.00 – £0.49</li>
                                        <li>£50.01+ – £0.59</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>10.4 The "Platform Fee Slabs" and "Platform Fee" associated with each "Slab" shall be reviewed and increased/decreased/amended at the "Platform Provider's" sole discretion. The applicable "Platform Fee" shall be specified for each transaction individually and included in the "Total Cost".</p>
                                    <p>10.5 The "Platform Fee" shall have VAT included in it, even if we are not VAT registered. Should the Customer requires a VAT receipt for the full value of their order, the Customer should contact the Company for a receipt detailing the order and delivery fees, and contact separately "Platform Provider" in writing to accounts@eposhybrid.com with their request for a receipt detailing the "Platform Fee". The "Platform Provider" (ePOS Hybrid) shall endeavour to provide a VAT invoice within seven (7) business days.</p>
                                    <p>10.6 All "Platform Fees" are strictly non-refundable.</p>
